# Malloc Learning

## Use a freed pointer
After we free a pointer, we can still use it, but this is wrong and dangerous!! Free just tell the computer we do not want this memoryaddress, you can allocate these region in heap to other malloc() call in the future.

In the file `free.c`, we `free(mess)`, but we can still assign 33 to `*mess`, and print its content.

```
➜  Malloc_0708_17 git:(dev) ✗ ./a.out
*mess is 	53
```

The dangerous is if the following malloc reuse the memory address which mess point to, our previous value 33 will be overwrite without any notice.

The best practice is to assign null to the pointer `mess = null` in this case. Then if we want to assign to mess, it will have error.

```
➜  Malloc_0708_17 git:(dev) ✗ ./a.out
[1]    10172 segmentation fault  ./a.out
```

## Free the address of pointer_ Wrong!
Don't free `&mess`, it's located in Stack and it's a local variable. Not generated by malloc.

The content at the address `&mess = 0x7fff5056a9d8`, which is `0x7fb777c02600`, is generated by Malloc() and located in Heap, this can be freed.

```
mess is 	0x7fb777c02600    <------ In Heap
&mess is 	0x7fff5056a9d8    <------ In Stack
a.out(10464,0x7fffa803f3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fff5056a9d8: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
[1]    10464 abort      ./a.out
```

## Double Free
Try to free a freed pointer, SEG Falut.

```
mess is 	0x7fa2aa402600
&mess is 	0x7fff5b95c9d8
a.out(10830,0x7fffa803f3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fa2aa402600: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
[1]    10830 abort      ./a.out
```
