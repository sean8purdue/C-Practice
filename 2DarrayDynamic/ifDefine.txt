1.
Use #if Not #ifdef

Use #if MACRO not #ifdef MACRO. Someone might write code like:
#ifdef DEBUG
        temporary_debugger_break();
#endif
Someone else might compile the code with turned-of debug info like:
cc -c lurker.cc -DDEBUG=0
Alway use #if, if you have to use the preprocessor. This works fine, and does the right thing, even if DEBUG is not defined at all (!)
#if DEBUG
        temporary_debugger_break();
#endif
If you really need to test whether a symbol is defined or not, test it with the defined() construct, which allows you to add more things later to the conditional without editing text that's already in the program:
#if !defined(USER_NAME)
 #define USER_NAME "john smith"
#endif

2.
Using #if 0

The easiest way to do this is with an #if 0 block:
   void 
   example()
   {
      great looking code

      #if 0
      lots of code
      #endif
    
      more code
    }
You can't use /**/ style comments because comments can't contain comments and surely a large block of your code will contain a comment, won't it?
